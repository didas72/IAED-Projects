# IAED-Projects

This repository contains my answers\* to projects for the subject "Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures".

\*A fix was made to proj1. The program no longer displays an error when creating the 200th route.

The makefiles in `/proj#` are the original made by me and are not great.

In 2024 I decided to also do the project, the final result is under `/23_24`.

Under `/memctrl` there are 4 files, which were used to check the code for memory leaks during development of `proj2`. I had no access to internet during a good part of the devolopment, and needed a tool similar to valgrind. While it is nowhere as capable as valgrind, it did prove extremely useful to find the majority of issues with the code. These files were not included in the final submission but were kept for future reference. This project was later rewritten and used to make the `23_24` project, and the source can be found in the new [repo](https://github.com/didas72/alloc_check).
