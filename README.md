# IAED_A1

This repository contains the submissions I made\* for "Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures".

\*A fix was made to proj1. The program no longer displays and error when creating the 200th route.

The makefiles in /proj# are the original made by me and are not great.

In the root directory there are 4 other files, all related to memctrl, which were used to check the code for memory leaks during development at a time where I couldn't get valgrind. They were not included in the final submission but were kept for future reference.
